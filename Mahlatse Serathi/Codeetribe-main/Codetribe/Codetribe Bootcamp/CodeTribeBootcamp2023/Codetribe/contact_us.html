            <p style="width: 10;">
            I am a very bubbly individual who is full of life and loves flowers. Born in the year 1995 on the 6th February, 
            originally from The Vaal Triangle but relocated to Soweto for better opportunities 4 years ago.<br>
            I always had an interest in Radio Broadcasting, Public Relations and<br>Communication Science, the Digital Space as 
            well as Digital Technology.<br> I matriculated in the year 2014 at The Vaal High School, which is the year that I can never
             forget because my mother passed on the day<br>when I was writing my final matric exam paper. In the year 2015 after collecting
            my matric statement, I always dreamed of studying at Boston Media House.<br>I tried to pursue a college Diploma in Radio
            Broadcasting at Boston Media House but dropped out of College due to lack of funds in 2016, then I had to stay at home for a year.
            <br> In 2017 I registered with UNISA for a Diploma in Public Relations which took me 4 years to complete instead of 3 years because 
            I had challenging issues at home. I then graduated in the 2021, which I am very proud of because it shows that my 
            main focus is obtaining good results even under underlining circumstances, simply because I enjoy taking charge and 
            love a great challenge! Although I can be quite competitive and with incredible will power, I am determined to achieve my goals.
